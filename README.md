Isn't Life better when your preferences are just a wget away?

Here in lies the dumping ground for all my config files that I
deem worthy enough to make the jump to any *nix based machine I happen
to be forced to work with.

This is also convenient when I'm in interviews and they perchance 
give me a laptop to code on. (It's happened before)

There's no guarantee these settings are the best or most efficient.
They've served me well though.
